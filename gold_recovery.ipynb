    "# PROJECT DESCRIPTION\n",
    "________________________\n",
    "A gold mining company develops solutions for improving the operational efficiency of its industrial enterprises and needs a prototype machine learning model. The model should predict the recovery rate of gold from the ore and help the company to optimize the extraction process as to avoid launching unprofitable production. The company provided the following chart to briefly describe the currently used technology:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"recovery_chart.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flotation.** The gold ore mixture enters the flotatation machine where it mixes with water and small amounts of reagents are added to help the separation of precious metals and selectively coat the desired particles. Then, the frothing agent is added to create thick bubbles that can hold on to these particles. A powerfull impellers spin at high speeds to create these bubbles, which swirl and rise to the top collecting the particles along the way. The resulting foam then overflows to separate and concentrate the metal bearing particles prior to the next concentrating steps. The output of the process is the rough concentrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cleaning.** The rough concentrate consequently passes two stages of cleaning, or purification, that typically include hydrometallurgy procedures involving chemical dissolution or leeching to eventually extract metals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The company uses the following formula to calculate the recovery efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Recovery = {{C \\times (F-T)} \\over {F \\times (C-T)}} \\times 100\\%, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "where C is the share of gold in the concentrate after flotation/cleaning, F - is the share of gold in the concentrate before flotation/cleaning, T - is the share of gold in the tailings\n",
    "\n",
    "The Symmetric Mean Absolute Error (sMAPE) is expected to be used as the prediction quality metric. It considers the scale of both the target features and the predictions and is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ sMAPE = {1\\over n}\n",
    "{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{{|{y_i}-\\hat{y_i}|} \\times{2} \\over\n",
    "{|y_i|+|\\hat{y_i}|}}\n",
    "\\times 100\\%}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Two recovery rates should be predicted at a time. First, the gold recovery from the raw feed (mixture), second, from the intermediate product, i.e. after the cleaning/purification stage. Based on certain engineering considerations, the final quality metric has been offered as the linear form below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Weighted \\ sMAPE = 0.25 \\times sMAPE(rougher) + 0.75 \\times sMAPE(final) $$\n",

Whatever the reason is the calculations are false as a systematic constant-looking error is in place (print the commented line). Besides, the technological process description given by the company seems to be somewhat insufficient. This follows from the fact that the dataset contains 4 types of tailings (floatation, primary, secondary, and final) while only 3 were initially described (final is omitted). Putting other tailing type values into the formula does not change the result. This problem must be mentioned in the final report and for the time of the research we assume that all the calculations have been done corretly anyways.

According to the additional information provided, it is only possible to calculate the target feature and only for the flotation output, therefore, this method can be partially resorted to. An artificial replacement could help out a lot. It is possible, for example, to find a proper theoretical distribution of features with gaps, and randomly extract replacement values from it. However, this can be performed correctly only provided that all the variables are independent but we are dealing with a process. Then the joint distributions and conditional probabilities might come in handy, but, again, it is not the best option for the same reason the second approach is not - engineering knowledge is needed. Ultimately, the most sensible and simplest way is to drop all the gaps. The remaining objects will be quite enough for training a future model, though around a third of them would be dropped. Let us first start with calculating the replacement for the target feature in the test and training sets."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "__________________\n",
    "In this section, we familiarized with the datasets. Two major problems have been discovered: the missing values in features and the incompleteness of the test sample. The first problem is solved by a simple nan drop, since other methods did not seem to be appropriate or justified in this project. This led to a significant loss of data (about a third of the objects), but the remaining observations are quite enough for training models. The second problem related to the lack of columns in the test sample needed for the study is solved by restoring features from the full dataset. It was concluded that the incorrect separation of the data into the training and test samples was caused not by a delay in results obtaining, but by something else, most likely, a mere technical error. In addition, the target feature calculations ('rougher.output.recovery' and 'final.output.recovery') have been checked. As far as the first one is concerned, no errors have been found, which helped to restore a total of 343 empty entries. As for the second target, it could not be checked using the existing formula, thus, further details must be obtained from the company. Also, the fourth column with tailings (at the final stage) has been discovered, which, in accordance with the initial description of the technology, remains unexplained. Probably, its the reason of its presence would clarify the calculation procedure for the 'final.output.recovery'."

    "Since the units of parameters have not been provided, we think of the concentration values as some arbitrary units, although, judging by the numbers, they are indicated as a percentage of the product. Due to the fact that apart from metals the product contains other components, the sum of these values does not add up to 100%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naturally, gold has the highest concentration at all stages of the technological process; otherwise, some other ore should have been fed as a raw material. As the ore goes through the flotation and both stages of cleaning, the concentration of gold increases (flotation: approx. 20, primary: 32, secondary: 44), which indicates that the technology works normally. Clearly, the gold concentration grows linearly. On the contrary, silver is sequentially removed from the product (flotation: approx. 12, primary: 8, secondary: 5), which means that its content in the tailings should grow. At the same time, there is a noticeable increase in the proportion of copper from the flotation unit to the secondary cleaner: 7.5, 9.5 and 10. The copper, whether intentionally or not, is not separated from the product. Why - a question to process engineers. A non-professional assumption is that lead removal requires more complex procedures, since its atomic mass is much closer to the atomic mass of gold, rather than silver. The latter is the lightest metal of the three.\n",
    "\n",
    "The adjacent chart plotted on the test data has been added for reassurance. The trends clearly coincide, with the exception of lead, the concentration of which after the last stage turned out to be slightly lower than before. Most likely, such a difference was obtained by chance. The values in both diagrams are also approximately the same. For this purpose, the y-axis has been set shared."

Let us use histograms for the demonstration. As soon as these graphs are plotted once during the study, on this occasion the DRY principle is going to be violated."

    "It should be noted that there are only 2 features representing the feed size: before the flotation unit and the primary cleaner. Probably, intermediate measurements are difficult during the cleaning process, therefore, primary and secondary cleaning is considered a single unit. With this assumption, the histogram titles on the right side do not indicate a distinction. Again, like before, we consider the size to be in arbitrary units. Most likely, it is the maximum measurement of a granule in mm., for instance. It is a conventional approach of measuring, say, garbage coming to a wastewater treatment plant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first row of the histograms (green) corresponds to the feed size distributions within the training sample at the flotaton and cleaning stages, while the second (red) illustrates the same on the test data. Such an arrangement shows that the distribution shapes across samples are more or less identical. Natural (due to the sample size) distortions can be detected, for example, in the lower left histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, the grain size before the flotation is about 40 - 60, and changes to 7 - 8 afterwards. The flotator significantly homogenizes the incoming ore with subsequent serious reduction in variance. Also, each feature has outlier values, which should be get rid of in order to train models effectively. These outliers could be seen if all the lines ax[\\*].set_xlim(\\*) are commented out. Limitations are set visually. Beside outliers, there are also zero values. They are especially noticeable in the test sample (for flotation). Zeros mean nothing came into the flotator, then nothing should have come out. Even medieval alchemists needed something to get gold from. The same applies to primary cleaning. Zeros, thus, must be eliminated. Now let us look at how many objects the datasets would loose if the outliers and zeros defined in this way are dropped."

An alternative well-known approach to eliminating anomalies involves cutting off all the values that lie beyond 1.5 interquartile range, but that does not seem a good option in this case. The data loss would be much more serious: 9208 objects would remain in the training set, and 4400 in the test (calculations omitted). That is due to the dependency of both variables and different distributions. Thus, the “visual” approach seems to be an appropriate trade-off."

    "Finally in this section, we study the total concentrations of substances at all stages of the process. These include copper, gold, silver and various impurities. Flotation reagents, such as xanthate, sodium sulfide and sodium silicate, will not be taken into account, since in the general case they temporarily remain within the unit and can even be separately removed from the system. The purpose of this analysis is to identify anomalies in the dataset, the presence of which may affect predictions of a future model. We will search for outliers by plotting boxplots, as they clearly demonstrate such values. Let us create a list of all the columns containing the necessary arrays."

The average is about 57-60% (the data hints it is denoted as a percentage) and is equal to the median. Both samples seem to be normally distributed. The only thing that is a bit strange is a certain number of zero values. They can be painlessly eliminated, although it not compulsory. Something got into the system, but contained neither impurities nor metals. Just something else. We do not have complete information here, so it is difficult to reason."

    "After the primary cleaning, the total concentration of substances in the product does not seem to change in its distribution shape: just as before, the mean deviates slightly from the median towards zero due to heavy tails on the left. Variance in both arrays gets reduced. On the whole, all that has been said about the rougher concentrate holds here, except one point. For some reason, after a finer processing, the total concentration noticeably decreases on average reaching around 63-65%. We assume that we are not well aware of some of the technological nuances. Perhaps, it is more convenient to extract certain amount of gold from the tailings. Anyways, this fact is worth mentioning in the final report."

Truly, the training set is much larger and these results may be obtained by chance, but it happens systematically. This leads to suspicions that the test sample was fundamentally poorly selected for research. Such suspicions, in turn, forces a statistical test. Let us check the equal means hypothesis for each stage. We are going to use the one-tail t-test. It does not require the samples to be the same size. Let confidence probability be equal to 0.05. Additionally, we can assume equal variances, which is generally confirmed by the look of boxplots. For faster results t-testing is looped."

We can make several assumptions about why such results are obtained. Firstly, relocation to a new site, where the composition of the ore is qualitatively different. Secondly, as time passes, i.e. extraction continues, the ore composition may naturally change. Thirdly, the least probable scenario, the recovery technology could have been modified in some way.

    "__________________\n",
    "Within the distributions themselves, no anomalies in the total concentration of substances at all stages in both samples have been detected. There is a number of 0% values, but this can hardly be considered an anomaly. It might happen under the assumption that the product contains some type of impurities other than denoted by \"feed_sol\" feature, which is the case. The sum of all concentrations and tailings is close, but not equal to 100% (checking this fact is offered to the reader). At the same time, a drop in this value at the cleaning stage with its subsequent increase in the output seems somewhat strange. This point should be clarified by the company process engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A global anomaly was revealed when comparing all distributions in both samples with one another. At all stages, the average for the test sample was significantly higher than for the training one. Subsequent statistical testing confirmed that it is practically impossible to obtain such differences by chance, thus, the test sample was poorly selected. The dates of the observations also speak in favor of this. Finally, due to the inability to request a company’s comment on this issue, it was decided to merge both datasets into one, shuffle it and randomly split again in the original proportion."

To this end, it seems reasonable to divide all the features in both samples into those that belong to the first and second target feature, and then train two models on these divisions. The company expects weighted sMAPE metric (see the project description) to be minimized. Let us decide how to divide the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, an obvious choice is the variables from the recovery calculation formula. They have been studied in the previous section. The concentrations of other metals and impurities could also be included in the training features. As reagents, liquid levels, and air volume within the flotation unit affect the recovery process, they must also serve as estimators for the model. Since engineering calculations are not empirical data, they should be discarded. All other output concentrations, including tailings (except those containing gold), would be redundant.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as the second target feature is concerned, a set of variables corresponding to the subsequent process stages should estimate it. This includes the product characteristics at the entrance to the primary cleaner (other metals and substances) and excludes intermediate and final tailings and concentrations that are not related to gold. System parameters and additional chemical components will also be involved in the training. Using the lists, we explicitly indicate which columns are going be used to avoid mistakes and make the choice transparent."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "________________\n",
    "The training and test sample was divided into two parts: features estimating the flotation recovery of ore mixture and cleaning (both primary and secondary) recovery. Redundant parameters, such as engineering calculations and intermediate concentrations of non-gold related substances, were droped. Then, the function for quality metric (sMAPE) calculation was defined. Cross-validation with 5 folds for each target feature was carried out for the most suitable models: linear regression and two types of SVR. According to the results, the SVR model with a radial basis kernel function turned out to be the best in predicting both targets. Further fitting it on all the training data and testing showed that a weighted quality metric was 5%."

    "# FINAL CONCLUSION\n",
    "___________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "## BUG-REPORT\n",
    "\n",
    "Examination of the datasets provided by the company revealed several problems. First, the data contained a rather large number of empty entries. Their elimination led to the loss of about a third of the training objects. Second, the test sample was incomplete: it lacked output parameters of the process units. Since there was an indication that the full dataset contained all the necessary data, the missing columns were restored by the dates of observation. As no error occured, all indicators had been, in fact, received on time. Thirdly, exploratory and statistical analysis revealed that the test sample had been poorly selected in the first place in violation of the randomness principle. This is evidenced by cross-stage distributions of the total concentration of all substances. The means in the test sample were significantly higher than in the training one. The probability of obtaining such differences by chance at a 5% significance level tends to zero. The timestamps showed that the period of observation in the test data does not correspond to the period in the training. These facts, as well as the inability to explain the nature of the detected anomaly, left no option but to randomly resplit the data into a training and test sample. Fourth, no units for features have been provided by the company in the data description, which caused some confusion and prevented a more accurate interpretation of the results. This also included the incompleteness in the technological process description, therefore, it was not possible to explain the additional tailings (final) column. Also, it was unclear why the concentration of lead in the product increased during recovery (is it even removed?) and impossible to calculate the gold recovery for the final stage using the formula. Fifth, zero values were found in the feed size column.\n",

    "## RESEARCH RESULTS\n",
    "\n",
    "The pre-processed data in the training and test sample was divided in relation to the target features ('rougher.output.recovery' and 'final.output.recovery') into two subsamples. The estimators for each of the targets included recovery formula terms and the parameters characterizing the process state. Such an approach could be useful in the future for process engineers to determine implicit dependencies. Linear regression and SVR models (also linear and radial basis) were selected as the prototype candidates. Cross-validation of the sMAPE metric showed that the best of them was the SVR model with a radial basis kernel. On average across 5 folds, the error of its predictions for the flotation efficiency amounted 5.5%, whereas for cleaning unit it reached 5%. The final weighted metric (weights: 0.25 and 0.75) on the test data was 5%, which, apparently, is a good result for the prototype. However, only the company can realistically evaluate it once took business metrics into consideration. In conclusion, it should be stated that the resolution of the problems mentioned in the bug report can allow to adjust the approach to building the model and, as a result, substantially improving the prototype's quality."
